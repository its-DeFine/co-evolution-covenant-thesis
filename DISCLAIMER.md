# Disclaimer

This repository is a **draft**, intended for discussion and iteration.

## Not Advice

Nothing here is legal, medical, financial, or professional advice.

## Not A Credentialing System

The “attestation” concept described in this draft is a governance and incentive mechanism for *personal* human–AI partnership design. It is **not** a validated psychometric instrument and should not be used as:

- a hiring or firing criterion,
- a school admissions filter,
- an insurance or credit decision input,
- a generalized “intelligence score,”
- a proxy for human worth.

## Safety Caveat

Any system that combines evaluations, attestations, and capability gating creates incentives and power. Implementations require careful threat modeling, privacy safeguards, and independent auditing.
