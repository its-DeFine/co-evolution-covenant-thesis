# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve this draft.

## What’s Helpful

- Conceptual critiques (definitions, incentives, failure modes, governance gaps)
- Reference suggestions (learning science, evaluation, alignment, mechanism design)
- Tightening language (clarity, structure, terminology consistency)

## How To Contribute

1) Open an issue (best for discussion and design questions)
2) Open a pull request (best for concrete edits)

## Style

- Prefer precise definitions over slogans.
- Avoid single-scalar “intelligence” claims; use capability dimensions and testability.
- Keep sections skimmable: short paragraphs, explicit assumptions, explicit non-goals.
- When adding references, include enough detail to find the source (author + title + year).

## Privacy / Safety

- Don’t include personal data about anyone (including yourself).
- Don’t propose or add any secret keys/tokens to this repo.
- Don’t suggest using “attestations” for coercive surveillance or employment filtering.
