# Spec (draft)

This folder contains draft, implementation-oriented artifacts for the Co‑Evolution Covenant.

- `attestation.schema.json` — a proposed JSON Schema for attestations
- `authorship-proof.schema.json` — a proposed JSON Schema for authorship proofs
- `bdi.schema.json` — a proposed JSON Schema for the Bindable Declaration of Intent (BDI)
- `authorship-registry.contract.md` — draft smart-contract spec for on-chain authorship anchors
- `hashing.md` — canonicalization + hashing rules for proofs
- `examples/` — example objects

These are **not standards** and are expected to change.
