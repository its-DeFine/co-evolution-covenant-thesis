# Roadmap

## Near-term

- Add “Design goals / non-goals” section
- Formalize the attestation object (schema + example)
- Add evaluation rubric with anti-gaming measures
- Expand related work (learning science + alignment + mechanism design)
- Add diagrams for the Governor/Evaluator/Auditor architecture

## Later

- Convert thesis into a short paper + appendix pack
- Add a “minimal implementation spec” (interfaces + threat model)
