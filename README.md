# The Co‑Evolution Covenant (Thesis Draft)

This repository contains an in-progress thesis draft on a constructive human–AI partnership model: an AI that is *with* you (and controlled by you) while both human capability and AI capability evolve together in a governed, positive‑sum loop.

**Status**: Under active development — not yet finalised.

## Read

- `THESIS.md` — main draft

## Proofs

- `proofs/author-proof.ethereum.json` — signed authorship claim for `THESIS.md` (EIP-191 `personal_sign` style)

Verification options:

- Etherscan “Verify Signature” tool (paste message + signature + address): https://etherscan.io/verifySig
- Programmatic verification (e.g. `ethers.verifyMessage(message, signature)` should recover the same address)

## Specs

- `spec/` — draft JSON schemas and contract notes (implementation-oriented; expected to change)

## Feedback

- Open an issue for critique, missing references, or conceptual gaps.
- Open a PR for edits (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
