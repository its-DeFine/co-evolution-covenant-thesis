# Evaluation (draft)

This folder contains draft, implementation-oriented documents for evaluating **human autonomous capability** (not “intelligence scores”) in the Co‑Evolution Covenant framework.

These docs aim to be concrete enough to implement, while explicitly guarding against misuse.

- `protocol.md` — test types, cadence, sampling, and anti-gaming design
- `rubric.md` — capability dimensions and scoring guidance

See also: `DISCLAIMER.md` and `THESIS.md`.
